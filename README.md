## Interactive Photo Gallery Assignment

### Objective
Build an interactive photo gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The focus is on utilizing JavaScript events to create a dynamic and user-responsive experience. This project challenges you to handle events such as clicks, hovers, and filtering to enhance interactivity.

### Requirements

#### Gallery Setup
- Structure your photo gallery using HTML. Each photo should display as part of a grid or list, featuring a thumbnail image, a title, and an optional description.

#### CSS Styling
- Style the gallery to be visually appealing and responsive, ensuring proper arrangement of items across different screen sizes. Implement interactive states, such as hover effects, for a better user experience.

#### JavaScript Events
- Incorporate the following features through JavaScript events:
  - **Image Enlargement**: Clicking on a thumbnail should open a larger version of the image, possibly in a modal or overlay.
  - **Hover Details**: Display the title and description when hovering over an image.
  - **Filtering**: Include options to filter the gallery by categories (e.g., all, nature, cities).

#### Advanced Features (Optional)
- Implement a search functionality to filter gallery items by their title.
- Add a lightbox feature for navigating through enlarged photos.

### Instructions

1. **Gallery Structure**
   - Create the HTML layout for your gallery, including `div` containers for gallery items with `img` and optional `p` tags for images and descriptions.

2. **Styling**
   - Use CSS for styling. Employ flexbox or CSS grid for layout management and add hover effects for interactivity.

3. **Implementing Interactivity**
   - Add event listeners for gallery interactions:
     - Modal or overlay opening on thumbnail click.
     - Showing/hiding details on hover.
     - Gallery filtering based on categories.

4. **Testing**
   - Thoroughly test your gallery's functionality, ensuring compatibility across different browsers and devices.

### Submission
Submit the following:
- `gallery.html`: HTML file for the gallery.
- `gallery.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `gallery.js`: JavaScript file for interactive features.

Include a brief guide on interacting with your gallery and any special features implemented.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Responsive and visually appealing gallery design.
- Correct implementation of JavaScript events for interactivity.
- Innovative design and functionality, especially for any advanced features.
- Quality and organization of code, including comments for clarity.
